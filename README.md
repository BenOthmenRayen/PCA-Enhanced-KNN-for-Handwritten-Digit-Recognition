# PCA-Enhanced-KNN-for-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project demonstrates handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset. It applies PCA to reduce the dimensionality of 784 features while preserving 95% of the variance. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is then trained on the reduced data. The goal is to improve computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy.
